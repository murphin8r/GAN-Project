# GAN-Project
This is a project that was a part of an AI engineering course. It features a generative adversial network or GAN that was tasked with creating synthetic faces. I used my dad as the candidate for the GAN to see if the network could create recongizable photos. In order to have training data for the network, I used a facial recongition software mainly purposed for security cameras. I then imported all of my family's photos from a Onedrive account and used the recongition software to create cropped photos of every face from each photos. I then scrubbed the data for my dad's face and fed the data into the GAN. The results of the project are at the bottom of the runbook.
