# GAN-Project
This is a project that was a part of an AI engineering course. It features a generative adversarial network or GAN that was tasked with creating synthetic faces. I used my dad as the candidate for the GAN to see if the network could create recognizable photos. In order to have training data for the network, I used a facial recognition software mainly purposed for security cameras. I then imported all of my family's photos from a OneDrive account and used the recognition software to create cropped photos of every face from each photo. I then scrubbed the data for my dad's face and fed the data into the GAN. The results of the project are at the bottom of the runbook.
